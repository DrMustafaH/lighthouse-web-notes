### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function (hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log('Get back to work!')
  } else if (hungry && availableTime < 20) {
    console.log("Pick up something up and eat in the lab.");
  } else if (hungry && availableTime >= 20 && availableTime < 30) {
    console.log("Try a place nearby.");
  } else {
    console.log("We're in bootcamp! how much time can we spare?!");
  }
};
```
